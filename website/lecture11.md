* In this lecture we continued on Rust's Bus model and illustrated 2 common estimation strategies.
* The materials for this are in a folder [here](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week10), in particular `ZurcherEstimation.jl`
* Here is a [static version](https://raw.githack.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/master/lecture_notebooks/week10/ZurcherEstimation.html) of that notebook.
