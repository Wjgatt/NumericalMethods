<h1>Lecture 12 - EGM and DC-EGM</h1>
~~~

* In the final lecture we talk about the Endogenous Gridpoint Method and its extension with discrete choice via DC-EGM
* [here is the notebook](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week11)
* and a [static version](https://raw.githack.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/master/lecture_notebooks/week11/EGM.html)

We will end up on [this github repo implementing the DC-EGM algo in julia](https://github.com/floswald/DCEGM.jl)
