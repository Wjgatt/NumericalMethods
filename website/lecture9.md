## Still Dynamic Programming!

* Finish up dynamic programming 2 (`dp2.jl`) in the [this](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week7) folder.
* Talk about [Chase Coleman, Spencer Lyon, Lilia Maliar and Serguei Maliar, (2018). "Matlab, Python, Julia: What to choose in economics?" forthcoming in Computational Economics](https://web.stanford.edu/~maliars/Files/CEPR-DP13210.pdf): *Seven ways to solve the optimal growth model*. 
    * The offical repo of Spencer Lyon is here [https://github.com/sglyon/CLMMJuliaPythonMatlab](https://github.com/sglyon/CLMMJuliaPythonMatlab)
    * I prepared an updated notebook for julia 1.5+ [here](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week8/).


## Quick Intro to Julia and Data

Notebooks: [here](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/tree/master/lecture_notebooks/week8/)

* We'll give a very quick intro to working with data in julia. 
* This will be too short to cover all important concepts. I will refer you to several additional sources:
    * This tutorial series is _very_ good for the DataFrames.jl package: [https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial](https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial)
    * The [julia academy data science tutorial](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/DataScience) is full of excellent stuff
    * The [Turing Institute's Data Sciences tutorials](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/DataScienceTutorials.jl/) give a good intro to data structures and machine learning in julia.
* The main part of that section will illustrate use of the `FixedEffectsModels.jl` package and how it compares to R competitors.
