# Homework 3 - Maximum Likelihood Estimation

This time you will build a fully-fledged maximum likelihood estimator for the probit model.

## Notebooks

Get the notebook here as usual. [right click and save this notebook, or copy the link directly into a running Pluto session to open!](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/blob/master/homework/homework3/Probit.jl)

[Here](https://raw.githack.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/master/homework/homework3/Probit.jl.html) is a static version to view.

**Notice: Project.toml file**

I recommend that you download the entire [folder](https://github.com/floswald/NumericalMethods/blob/master/homework/homework3) and then proceed as follows:

1. open julia in the location where you downloaded the folder
2. `] activate .`
3. `] instantiate`
4. `using Pluto; Pluto.run()`
5. start the `Probit.jl` notebook.



## Homework Submission - no moodle!

You need to submit by Thursday evening before the next class on Friday. Please **everybody** submit via the _dropbox file request link_ I shared on slack with you!

**How and What to Submit?**

* What? your Pluto notebook (that's a simple `.jl` file for the notebook)
* How? Please submit via dropbox file request. _please stick to the convention of naming your .jl files like `lastname_firstname_HWx.jl` for homework `x` - thanks!_
